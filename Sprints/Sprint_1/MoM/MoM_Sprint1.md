Meeting Number / Version: 01 (01/30/2026 Friday)
1. Agenda
Item 1: Review of current volunteer onboarding and scheduling workflow
Item 2: Overview of existing tools (WordPress, N8N, Rocket.Chat, Google Calendar)
Item 3: Discussion of CRM goals and current pain points
2. Key Discussion Points
Volunteers register through a WordPress website; data flows through n8n into the current system for review and training.
Approved volunteers are scheduled into recurring meetings with seniors, typically involving three volunteers per senior.
Scheduling notifications are sent via Rocket.Chat, and volunteers can add meetings to Google Calendar. 
Volunteers cannot directly cancel meetings in a way that notifies staff; cancellations and substitutions are handled manually through Rocket.Chat.
Volunteers and seniors complete feedback forms after meetings; details around frequency and timing will be finalized later.
The client would like a CRM platform to centralize volunteer, senior, meeting, and feedback information for better tracking and administration. 
3. Decisions Made
The new CRM platform will focus on operational tracking rather than replacing existing communication or calendar tools.
Rocket.Chat will continue to be used for communication, including cancellations and substitutions. 
Google Calendar will continue to be used for scheduling. 
Database design will be the first implementation task, using Baserow. 
4. Action Items / Responsibilities

5. Client Feedback / Clarifications
The current biggest challenge is managing cancellations and substitutions for recurring meetings with multiple volunteers.
Feedback form processes are still flexible and will be refined later in the project.
